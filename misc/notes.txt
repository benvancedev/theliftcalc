BMR - The Foundation For Everything (Basal Metabolic Rate)

Every aspect of the calculation revolves around knowing your Basal Metabolic Rate, so before you do anything, it is critical to work out your personal BMR properly. In our opinion, the Katch-McArdle variant is the most accurate formula. The formula is as follows

P=370+ (21.6 LBM) (lean body mass)

1.2 = sedentary (little or no exercise)
1.375 = light activity (light exercise/sports 1 to 3 days per week)
1.55 = moderate activity (moderate exercise/sports 3 to 5 days per week)
1.725 = very active (hard exercise/sports 6 to 7 days per week)
1.9 = extra active (very hard exercise/sports 6 to 7 days per week and physical job)




BMI Calculator

BMI = weight(kg) / [height(m)*height(m)]
BMI = 703 * weight(lbs) / [height(in)*height(in)]

function bmiCalculator(weight, height) {
    var bmi = weight / (height * height);
    return Math.round(bmi);
}

var bmi = bmiCalculator(65, 1.8);
console.log(bmi);




Max Lifts

For lbs

1 Rep - 100% max lift
2 Reps - 95% max lift
3 reps - 93% max lift
4 reps - 90% max lift
5 reps - 87% max lift
6 reps - 85% max lift
7 reps - 83% max lift
8 reps - 80% max lift
9 reps - 77% max lift
10 reps - 75% max lift
11 reps - 73% max lift
12 reps - 70% max lift

If you know your "x" rep max, and you want to find out what your 1 rep max should be for that exercise, devide the coefficent by the corresponding "rep #".

Reps	CoEfficient
1	1.00
2	.943
3	.906
4	.881
5	.856
6	.831
7	.807
8	.786
9	.765
10	.744
11	.723
12	.703
13	.688
14	.675
15	.662
16	.650
17	.638
18	.627
19	.616
20	.606


For kgs

Calculate your 1RM using these formulas*. For your upper body, find the heaviest weight you can lift 4-6 times and plug it into this equation: (4.6RM X 1.1307) + 0.6998.

So if you can do 5 reps of 60kg, then according to the formula � (60 x 1.1307) + 0.6998 � your 1RM will be 68.5kg. For lower body use this formula: (4-6RM x 1.09703) + 14.2546. Got a decimal point? Go on, round it up.
